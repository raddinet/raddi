A project aiming to develop and introduce radically decentralized discussion platform. Employs reddit-esque concepts of user identities, communities, discussion trees, voting and moderator influence on content quality, built on modern cryptography. Decentralized, uncensorable.

## Status
Preview of node software, with limited-functonality command line application, is available for enthusiasts,
downloadable from [raddi-builds-windows](https://github.com/raddinet/raddi-builds-windows) repository.

## Dependencies
Pre-built binaries of required libraries are available from [raddi-redist-windows](https://github.com/raddinet/raddi-redist-windows) repository.
Those are needed only for *release* builds. For *portable* builds everything necessary is already compiled in.
